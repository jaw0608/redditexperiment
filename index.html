<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">History:</h2>
<p>The Reddit Reader was founded by Joe, a college Comp Sci student delivering for Uber Eats. Instead of listening to the same 200 songs (they get old quick), he started listening to Reddit compilation videos. But after finding that he couldn't get any channels that consistently read from the same Reddit subs, he made the Reddit Reader and now has PLENTY of content. When others seemed to love it to, he expanded to have more Reddit subs and post more frequently.&nbsp;</p>
